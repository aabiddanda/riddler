\subsection*{Problem}

You and I stumble across a 100-sided die in our local game shop. We know we need to have this die — there is no question about it — but we’re not quite sure what to do with it. So we devise a simple game: We keep rolling our new purchase until one roll shows a number smaller than the one before. Suppose I give you a dollar every time you roll. How much money do you expect to win?

\subsection*{Solution}

We will make the assumption that each dice roll is independent. Our real variable of interest is the number of dice rolls that we are able to roll on.
